- ### Implement quick actions
    - Share password quick 
    - Generate password quick (function already exist just need to implement the quick action view and the logic to generate a password)
    - Security checks quick (Implement a function that will make list password by strenght, basic level is password compliant, ~ 75 entropy)
    - Create group quick (function already exist just need to implement the quick action view and the logic to create a group)
    - Security Alerts quick (Might, or might not be implemented, but we query a service like haveibeenpwned to check if a password has been compromised)
